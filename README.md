## 📌 About the Organization

**KiraDrugs Initiative** is a youth-led association composed of individuals with lived experience of drug use, as well as friends, families, and community members affected directly or indirectly. The organization forms a vital network of people who understand the health, economic, and social challenges faced by people who use drugs.

By working together, members are committed to improving the living conditions of youth in general—and users and former users in particular—through tailored support and assistance.
